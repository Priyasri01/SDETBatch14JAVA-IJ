Access Modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywrods in java that control the access of methods fields or the class itself.
    There are four access levels.
Private:
    If something has the access level of private that thing can only be accessed within the same class. This acess
    level is the most restricted one. For fields/properties/state of a class, we should always try to have private access level so that the data of a class is
    secured.
Default:
    Default is not a keyword. it's an access level. if we don't use any keyword with fields or methods java applies the dafault access
    level automatically. Once applied we can access those entities within the same class as well as in any class within teh same package.
Protected:
    When applied entities can be accessed outside the package as well but only on the class that have parent-child relationship.
Public:
     When the public access modifier is applied to an entity that entity can be accessed anywhere inside that project.
     Usually the classes itself and methods are declared as public.
Note:
If we are inside the same class we can call a method inside another by just writing its name. But we need
to take care that these methods are both either static or non-static.

note:
non-static means.. we call the method through abject.

note:
 we if we have varaible , if we need to call instead of  typing all the sys out. we can just type "sysov"and enter u will get the full line.
 ex:
 "soutv + enter"
 System.out.println("humera = " + humera); // output

Constructor Method:


What is constructor?
initialize the object

Is Constructor can be overload?
Similar to methods you can also overload constructors i.e. you can write more than constructor with different parameters.
And, based on the parameters we pass at the time of instantiation, respective constructor will be invoked.

we have two major benefits for using the constructor
-constructor helps us build the objects in more cleaner way.
-it gives us more control over the data over all feilds,beacuse of the way they are initialized now.Instead of access the feild directly and then just start assign value to those,like how we do in main method create obj for the class.and calling through object.
-And just like method constructor also will have access modifier , the most commonly used modifier is "Public".

/*important note:  constructor  is mainly  for intialize the value , so in real work we won't put syso out.
we won't get any compiler error.but it's not good practice to put syso out inside the Constructor.*/

/*important note:  method  is for action meaning we can have sysout & we can get return value also . */

Note:
Constructor chaining refers to calling a constructor from other constructor. It is of two types.

Within same Class − Use this() keyword to refer to current class constructor. Make sure that this() is the first statement of the constructor and there should be at least one constructor without using this() statement.

From super/base Class − Use super() keyword to refer to parent class constructor. Make sure that super() is the first statement of the constructor.
