"this" keyword:

    this keyword refer the object itself.
    The main purpose of this keyword is to avoid confusion between instant and local varaible.
    "this" is a keyword like "class", "void". it is used in many places. For example
    if we have same name instance and a local variable we can use "this" to
    explicitly refer to instance variable. We can use "this()" to call a constructor inside another
    constructor as long as they are in same class.

 note: this keyword cannot be used in the static context.
this keyword can be used to:
-reference instance data feilds.
-reference instance method
-Invoke a constructor
why we are have more constructor?
 To povide more flexibility to user.

why should we learn about "this" keyword:
    1)it allows us to have same name local and instance variables.
    2) if we have same code in two constructors we can reuse that code from one constructor
    inside another constructor by writing "this()".
Inheritance:
    Inheritance is a mechanism in java through which we can use the fields/methods of
    one class inside another class.Basically access the fields/method/constructor from one class to another class by using "extends" keyword.
    in order to make inhertance class their need to be connection/same track.

There are 4 types of inheritance.

note: There can be 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3(first 3) of them with classess.

    1) Single inheritance:
        In single inheritance we have only one parent and one child class.
        Employee->Person.

    2) Multilevel Inheritance:
        In Multilevel inheritance we have inheritance in multiple levels like we have a grandfather-> father->son->grand son.
        means one parent and there are many children but not direct children. basically it goes like chain.
like:one base class, one derived class and multiple intermediate classes
     3) Hierarchical inheritance:
       one parent class and multiple direct child classes.

    4) Multiple inheritance:(it is not supported by classes in Java)
        one child class can directly inherit from multiple parent classes. it is not supported by java because of diamond problem.
what is diamond problem?
same name of method in both parent classes, because of java does not know which one to call
Why should we learn inheritance?
    It allows to reduce the duplicate code.
what is the syntax?
    we can use this feature by writing extends keyword when declaring a class.
============================================================================================
note: inside the class the Squance is not matter . we can create method first and next we can create reference variable and we can create constructor and so on...
but only in main method the sequence is matter. compiler will check the code from top to bottom and left to right.

==============================================================
super keyword is reference varaible.

note: "this" keyword help us to call the constructor  from the same class.
whereas "super" keyword help us to call the constructor from the parent class.

Because constructor not participated while we inherit the class.
