About Properties files:


Properties files are mainly used in Java programs to  maintain project configuration data, database config  or project settings etc.
Properties  files  stores  simple  parameters  as key-value  pairs,  outside  of  compiled  code.  Key  and  Values are separated using = sign.
Example:
Key=Value     or      Key:Value
School=Syntax
We can easily read properties from some file using object of type Properties. This is a utility provided by Java itself.
The  advantage  of  using  properties  file  is  we  can  configure things which are prone to change over a period of time without need of changing anything in
code.

Properties class is child class of Hashtable.
values which is changes frequently can be managed using properties fiels.
Values which is changes frequently can not be hard coded in the java program.
Each change in the source file requires recompile, rebuild, redeploy of the application which is very costly operation.

To avoid these things, need to configure these properties in properties file.
Properties object can be used to hold the properties which are coming from the properties file.
Properties file can be used to represent a group of key-Value pairs where both the key and values are of String type.

Methods:
-String getProperty(String propertyName): Returns value associated with the  specified property.
-String setProperty(String propertyName,String property value):it set the new property in the properties file and returns the old value if the property already available.Returns null if the specified property not available.
-Enumeration propertyNames(): Return all the property  names.
-void load(InputStream is):To load properties form properties  file to Java properties Object
-void store(OutputStream os,  String comment): To Store properties from java properties object to properties file.

FileHandling in java:
    Reading, writing and manipulating files using java code is called fileHandling.

Why should we learn FileHandling:
    1) When we perform data driven testing we need to store data in files.

    2) Storing critical data like userNames and passwords inside the code is bad, because when we push the code to GitHub
    that info will also be pushed with it, to avoid this we use properties files.

    3)we don't have to hard code , because these documents can be change any time.  so better to have it file and use it when ever we need it in the program.

    3) Sometimes data can be huge in GBs, and it is very bad practice to push GBS to GitHub.

How can we read data from a file?
    1) First we need to know the location(path) of the file.
    2) Navigate to that location where file is stored.
    3) We need a special class/Software that can help us read/write to that file.

About FileInputStream & FileOutputStream:

FileInputStream  and  FileOutputStream  classes  comes  from  java.io  package  and  used  to  read  and write data in the file.
In another word, they  are used for file handling in java.  FileInputStream  is  useful  to  read  data  from  a file.
Java FileOutputStream is an output stream for writing data to a file.


About Apache POI:
Apache POI is an open source java library  to create and manipulate various file  formats based on Microsoft Office (doc,
docx, ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx).
Apache POI is mostly used for reading and writing excel documents.It has many  predefined methods, classes, and
interfaces that we can use to read and write into Excel files
